# CVE-2022-3590 WordPress Vulnerability Scanner

This Python script is designed to check whether a WordPress website is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3590 vulnerability. The vulnerability exploits an unauthenticated blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the pingback feature of WordPress.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to use this script.

### Prerequisites

This script requires Python 3 and the `requests` library. You can install the necessary requirements using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

You can run the script from the command line with the following syntax:

```
python3 scanner.py [-u URL | -f FILE] [-d DOMAIN]
```

Here is what each argument does:

- `-u URL` or `--url URL`: The URL of the WordPress website to check.
- `-f FILE` or `--file FILE`: A file containing a list of URLs of WordPress websites to check.
- `-d DOMAIN` or `--domain DOMAIN`: The domain controlled by the attacker.

### Example

To scan a single website:

```
python3 scanner.py -u https://example.com
```

To scan multiple websites from a file:

```
python3 scanner.py -f urls.txt
```

### Output

The script will output whether each scanned website is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3590 vulnerability.
